description: help update the content of world66 in batches. invoke when the user asks you to help with a to do item
argument-hint: <task-name>

If no task name is provided, list the available tasks by looking at subdirectories of `todo/`. Show the task name, a one-line summary from TASK.md, and how many shards remain. Let the user pick one.

If a task name is provided, pick up a random shard from `todo/$ARGUMENTS/` and process it. These tasks are typically about updating the content in `content/`, so make sure you understand the task at hand in terms of folder structure. Read CLAUDE.md, STYLE.md, and any other docs referenced by TASK.md before starting.

## Steps

1. **Check prerequisites**
   - Ensure `gh` (GitHub CLI) is installed. If not, install it with `brew install gh`.
   - Ensure you're on a clean `main` branch. If not, stash or commit first.

2. **Pick a shard**
   - Look in `todo/$ARGUMENTS/` for `.txt` batch files.
   - Pick one at random from all available shards Pick at random, run an actual script.
   - Read the shard file to get the list of items to process.

3. **Check for existing PRs**
   - Branch name convention: `todo-$ARGUMENTS-<shard>` (e.g., `todo-country_cleanup-batch_00`).
   - Use `gh pr list --state all --search "todo-$ARGUMENTS-<shard>"` to check if a PR already exists (open or merged).
   - also check if the branch already exists, sometimes PRs get misnamed but have the same branch pattern.
   - If it does, pick a different shard. If all shards have PRs, report that the task is complete.

4. **Create a branch**
   - `git checkout -b todo-$ARGUMENTS-<shard>`

5. **Read the task description**
   - Read `todo/$ARGUMENTS/TASK.md` to understand what needs to be done for each item.

6. **Process each item in the shard**
   - Read the shard file line by line.
   - For each item, perform the task described in TASK.md.
   - After finishing an item, mark it done in the page's frontmatter:
     `python3 tools/mark_done.py $ARGUMENTS <path/to/page.md>`
     This adds `<task>: <today>` to the `done:` dict in the frontmatter. Run it
     on the main location/country file for the item (the top-level `.md`, not
     each section/POI). Stage the change as part of the same item commit.
   - Commit each item separately with the commit message format specified in TASK.md.
   - Do NOT push until all items are processed.

7. **Delete the shard file**
   - After all items are processed, delete the batch file.
   - Commit: "Complete: todo/$ARGUMENTS/<shard>"

8. **Push and create a PR**
   - `git push -u origin todo-$ARGUMENTS-<shard>`
   - Create PR with `gh pr create`:
     - Title: `todo-$ARGUMENTS-<shard>`
     - Body: list the items processed and a brief summary of changesA
   - IMPORTANT: name the PR exactly like that - don't add number of files changed or some such
   - Return the PR URL.
   - Show the review link: `http://127.0.0.1:8066/review?branch=todo-$ARGUMENTS-<shard>`

## Rules

- Process ALL items in the shard before creating the PR. One shard = one PR.
- Each item within the shard gets its own commit.
- Read TASK.md carefully — it defines the specific work for each item.
- Don't push individual commits. Push once at the end, then create the PR.
- If an item fails or can't be processed, note it in the PR description and move on.
- IMPORTANT: Make sure you get the title right. don't add words etc, we use the title to check if work has been done before.
